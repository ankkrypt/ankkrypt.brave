## Send Crypto Tip

For Web3 users on **Brave Browser**, the `.brave` domain resolves directly to your wallet:  

- Click **Send Crypto Tip** in the game.  
- You will be redirected to [Send Crypto Tip Page](https://ankkrypt.github.io/send-crypto.html) with a **dynamic QR code**.  
- Or open directly in Brave Wallet: `brave://wallet/send?address=ankkrypt.brave`  

For Web2 users (via GitHub Pages), you can test the game but crypto tipping only works in Brave Browser through the `.brave` domain.
